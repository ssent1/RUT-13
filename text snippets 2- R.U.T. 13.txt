<p>Think about your relationship with your hairdressers &ndash; past and present. They stroke you, caress your hair, and  learn about your dreams and desires. It's a personal relationship built on trust. A bad cut or colour leaves you frustrated and betrayed. A great cut makes can make you feel an incredible love.</p>

<p>We want you to have that feeling long after you have left the salon. The products that we use play an incredible role in maintaining, an even improving, the quality of hair. This inspired us to work with the leading cosmetic formulation chemists to create what could possibly be the best hair care &ndash; ever! We asked our chemists to remove the junk. We've eliminated sulphates! We've kicked parabens to the curb! Phthalates? In R.U.T. 13 &mdash; not a chance! No junk! Period! What's left? Pure organic hair therapy.</p>

<p>R.U.T. 13 is not just about all the junk that we've left out. We think we've achieved our vision of creating a product that is more safe than just about every other product on the market that performs incredibly well for the most demanding hair stylists in the world &ndash; US!  </p>

<p>We encourage you to learn about our ingredients. We use highly concentrated plant-based extracts, proteins, and vitamins to give you the greatest possible benefits. Don't get suckered into buying products that use watered-down botanicals. They might sound good, but they do nothing for your hair. You could buy from big companies run by cost-cutting accountants. Or you can buy your hair care products from hairdressers that know and love hair. We know you have a lot of choices. That's why we put so much care and quality into our products. You will notice the difference when you get compliments on your hair.</p>
